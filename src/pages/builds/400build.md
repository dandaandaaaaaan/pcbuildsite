If you are looking at building a value gaming PC at this price point, do not follow this build as $400 SGD is not enough to play the latest titles at playable framerates. However, this PC will be great as a general purpose computer for a low price.

#### CPU
| AMD Athlon 3000G            |
| --------------------------- |

With 2 cores, 4 threads, integrated Radeon Vega graphics, and an unlocked multiplier for overclocking, the Athlon 3000G is a great option at a low price. However, due to the relative unpopularity of this CPU, it might be tough to find in stock in Singapore, despite being listed in multiple shop pricelists online. The alternative would be the higher end Ryzen 3 3200G, which will run about $60 more.

#### Motherboard
| MSI A320M-A PRO MAX              | AsRock A320M-HDV R4.0           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ![](../../assets/400-mobo-a.png) |![](../../assets/400-mobo-b.png) |
These are the few A320 series motherboards that are still somewhat available for purchase. They are barebones in terms of features, but are the cheapest compatible motherboards available for our CPUs. Do note that newer A520 series motherboards are NOT compatible with the Athlon 3000G and even the higher end Ryzen 3 3200G. If A320M motherboards are not in stock, the next option would be to upgrade to a B450M series motherboard.  

Price: $169-230 (combo with CPU, depending on availability)

#### Memory
| Kingston/Corsair/Klevv/G-Skill DDR4 8GB 2666MHz |
| ----------------------------------------------- |

A single stick of 8GB RAM from any reputable brand should be good enough at this price range. If you are buying this online, do ensure that the seller is local and is covered by local warranty, as all local RAM has a lifetime warranty. There are sellers who import RAM at slightly cheaper prices, but the difference is worth it for the warranty.  

Price: $40-50 

#### Storage
| Kingston A400 240GB             | Kioxia Exeria 240GB (ex-Toshiba)| Sandisk SSD PLUS 240GB         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | 
| ![](../../assets/400-ssd-a.jpg) |![](../../assets/400-ssd-b.png)  | ![](../../assets/400-ssd-c.png)|
An SSD is essential in any modern system, and at this price range I could only fit a 240GB SSD. Here are a few cheap SSD recommendations from reputable brands. These SSDs will definitely lack performance features, but they will get the job done in speeding up the PC.  

Price: $45-$55

#### Power Supply
| FSP HD 80+ 420W                 | Cooler Master MWE 450W          | Thermaltake Litepower 450W White |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ![](../../assets/400-psu-a.jpg) | ![](../../assets/400-psu-b.png) | ![](../../assets/400-psu-c.jpg)  |
As any experienced PC builder will tell you, never cheap out on the power supply. These 3 power supplies are the lower end models from reputable brands, and will do a great job in powering your system. Do not buy any power supplies from brands such as iCute, Headway, Vios, Gamemax, and Armageddon.  

Price: $49-59

#### Case
| Tecware Nexus M2                 | Tecware Nova M                   | Armageddon Vulcan V1x              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ![](../../assets/400-case-a.png) | ![](../../assets/400-case-b.png) | ![](../../assets/400-case-c.png) |
Tecware and Armageddon are the two cheapest brands for cases in Singapore, as they are brands based in South East Asia. Armageddon has the cheaper cases, but I tend to prefer the Tecware aesthetic, along with Tecware having better availability at Sim Lim Square. 

Price: $30-50  

#### Conclusion
The main challenge with this PC would be finding the Athlon 3000G in stock locally, as well as a cheap accompanying motherboard. This PC can be used as a fast general purpose PC, while being able to play e-sports games at 720p comfortably. However, if you are aiming to build the best gaming PC at this price point, look into buying used instead of new, as there is a lot more value in the used market.  

#### Final Price: $333-$444
